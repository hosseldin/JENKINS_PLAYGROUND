What is Groovy?
Groovy is a powerful, dynamic scripting language for the Java platform.

It’s very similar to Java in syntax.

But it’s easier and more flexible — you write less code to do more.

Jenkins is built on Java, so Groovy works natively with it.

What is a Groovy script?
A Groovy script is just a .groovy file — like a .py for Python — that contains commands written in the Groovy language.

In Jenkins, you can use Groovy scripts to:

Automate tasks inside Jenkins

Configure security and users

Create and manage jobs

Install plugins

And much more

Where and Why Do You Use Groovy in Jenkins?
There are two main places you use Groovy in Jenkins:

1. Init Groovy Scripts
Location:
/usr/share/jenkins/ref/init.groovy.d/

When are they used?
These scripts run automatically the first time Jenkins starts.

Why?
To automatically configure Jenkins without clicking buttons in the UI.

Example Use Cases:

Create users

Set up roles & permissions

Create default jobs

Install credentials

Perfect for Docker setups! You want Jenkins to be ready when it runs, without manual setup.

2. Jenkins Script Console (Manual)
Location:
Web UI → Manage Jenkins → Script Console

Why?
Run Groovy snippets manually at any time to:

Debug

Update configs

Automate something ad-hoc

📦 Why Use Groovy Scripts in Your Case?
You're doing a Dockerized Jenkins setup, so:

You use Groovy scripts in init.groovy.d/ to make Jenkins:

Automatically create a user

Install and configure Role-Based Authorization

Set up a sample pipeline job

You don’t want to do that manually every time you rebuild Jenkins — automation saves time and keeps everything consistent.
