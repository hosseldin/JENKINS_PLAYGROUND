    volumes:
      - jenkins_data:/var/jenkins_home  # Persist Jenkins home directory (job configs, plugins, etc.)
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock  # Allow Jenkins to communicate with host Docker daemon

# Define named volumes (for data persistence)
volumes:
  jenkins_data:  # Named volume to persist Jenkins data across container restarts

# Jenkins inside the container runs on port 8080
# Your host (Ubuntu) exposes port 8085 to the outside world (your browser, etc.)
# So when you go to http://localhost:8085, Docker forwards the traffic to Jenkins inside the container on port 8080
# Why use a different host port?
# Because your native Jenkins install on Ubuntu already uses 8080 â€” so you can't use the same port for both. Ports on the host must be unique.
# If you tried to use - "8080:8080" for the Docker container, it would conflict with the native Jenkins running on your machine.
