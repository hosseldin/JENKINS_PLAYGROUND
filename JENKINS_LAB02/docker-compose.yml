# Jenkins inside the container runs on port 8080
# Your host (Ubuntu) exposes port 8085 to the outside world (your browser, etc.)
# So when you go to http://localhost:8085, Docker forwards the traffic to Jenkins inside the container on port 8080
# Why use a different host port?
# Because your native Jenkins install on Ubuntu already uses 8080 â€” so you can't use the same port for both. Ports on the host must be unique.
# If you tried to use - "8080:8080" for the Docker container, it would conflict with the native Jenkins running on your machine.
